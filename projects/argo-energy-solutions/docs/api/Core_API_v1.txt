Core API v1
What is the Eniscope Core API?
The Eniscope Core API is a RESTful HTTP API that provides access to stored metering data along with metadata connected to the metering 
data organized in an Organization hierarchy. Access to the data stored on the Eniscope Platform is restricted to where in the hierarchy your 
account sits.
This documentation is aimed at getting a developer up to speed with requesting metering data from the Eniscope Platform. It provides 
everything needed to find devices and data channels from the available organizations and request metering data from those devices.

Accessing the API & Authentication
Accessing the API
The Live API can be accessed via https://core.eniscope.com/
Authentication
To access the Eniscope API, the application that uses the API must provide authentication using both Basic Authentication and an API key. 
Contact the support team to request an API key, they will configure and add a new Service to the Organization requiring API access.
Every request needs to include a valid Eniscope Platform user email address and the md5 hash of the user password or a user session 
token. The token is returned in the HTTP headers after a successful user login attempt.
To authenticate with the Eniscope API, follow these steps:
Obtain the user's email address, this will be used as the username. 
e.g. api@someorg.com
Calculate the MD5 hash of the user's password.
e.g. for the plain text password thisismypassword the MD5 hash would be 31435008693ce6976f45dedc5532e2c1
Create the Basic Authentication header that includes the username and the calculated MD5 hash as the password. The following is an 
example of how to include Basic Authentication in your request header:
Authorization: Basic {Base64Encode(emailAddress:MD5Password)}
Replace {Base64Encode(emailAddress:MD5Password)} with the Base64-encoded combination of the user's email address and MD5 
password hash.
e.g. using the example email address and password above 
{Base64Encode(api@someorg.com:31435008693ce6976f45dedc5532e2c1)}the Base64 encode would be 
YXBpQHNvbWVvcmcuY29tOjMxNDM1MDA4NjkzY2U2OTc2ZjQ1ZGVkYzU1MzJlMmMx
Include the API key in the request header with the index X-Eniscope-API.
X-Eniscope-API: {APIKey}
Replace {APIKey} with the actual API key which was provided by the support team.
Once the user login has been verified, response headers will include a token, by including this token header in all subsequent requests, 
no user login details are required while the session is still valid.
X-Eniscope-Token: {SessionToken}
Example cURL call
Security Recommendations
The API key should be kept confidential and should not be shared publicly.
Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between your application and the Eniscope API to ensure secure communication.
1curl --location --request GET 'https://core.eniscope.com/devices' \
2--header 'X-Eniscope-API: APIKey' \
3--header 'Authorization: Basic YXBpQHNvbWVvcmcuY29tOjMxNDM1MDA4NjkzY2U2OTc2ZjQ1ZGVkYzU1MzJlMmMx'

Access Control
Access to specific resources and endpoints may be restricted based on user roles and permissions. Ensure that you have the necessary 
access rights to perform the desired operations.
 

--- Page 5 ---

Collections & Relational data
Collections are subsets of resources associated with a specific parent resource. They allow related data to be retrieved that belong to a 
particular resource. Collections can be added to a resource's endpoint to retrieve additional information or related records.
Collections provide a convenient way to access related data without making separate API calls for each piece of information.
The availability of collections may vary based on the resource type and its relationships.
Usage
To access a collection associated with a resource, append the collection name to the resource's endpoint URL. For example:
/resource/{resourceId}/collection - Retrieves a collection associated with the specified resource.
Multiple collections can be included in a single request
Examples
Retrieve Alarm Rules for a Specific Alarm
To retrieve alarm rules linked to a specific alarm, use the following endpoint:
GET /alarms/{alarmId}/alarmrules
This call will return all the alarm rules associated with the specified alarm.
Retrieve Events for a Device
To retrieve events related to a specific device, you can use the following endpoint:
GET /devices/{deviceId}/events
This call will return all events associated with the specified device.
To retrieve the list of meters and tariffs for a device
GET /devices/{deviceId}/meters/tariffs/
Response
Within the API, requested collections are efficiently embedded within the JSON payload of the parent resource. These collections are 
presented as arrays, neatly organized and accessible by their specific collection names. This design facilitates seamless navigation and 
interaction with the associated collections, all conveniently encapsulated within the response of the parent resource. An example response 
is as follows:
1{
2   "accountingCode" : null,
3   "address1" : "Some Organization",
4   "address2" : "",
5   "address3" : "",

Filters, Sorting & Pagination
Response Content Type
By including the Accept Header, the format of the returning resource data can be set. The API can accept either Accept:text/json or 
Accept:text/xml
Request Query Filters
There are a number of ways to filter a list of resources returned by a resource end-point. Each resource has a allowed list of filters that can 
be used to refine the list of resources returned.
The list of filters can be found for each resource by using the HTTP  OPTIONS Request
OPTIONS /devices/ Accept: text/json
The filters can then be used to filter the list of resources returned.
For example, the following will return all devices with deviceType equal to 6
GET /devices/?deviceType=6
The filters can be combined with wildcards to return the desired list.
Like: ?deviceName=*Eniscope
Equal to: ?deviceType=6
Not Equal to: ?deviceType=!6
Not Null: ?deviceType=!null
Null: ?deviceType=null
Multiple filters can appear more than once to allow for more complex queries
Like OR Null: ?deviceName=*Eniscope*&deviceName=null
Sorting
Filters can also be used as sorts on the returned list of resources, for example: 
Sort: ?sort=deviceName
Sort Ascending: ?sort=deviceName asc
Sort Descending: ?sort=deviceName desc
Pagination
When requesting lists of resources responses are split into pages with each page defaulting to 20 records per page.
To go to another page, add?page={page number} onto the request query string. The data in the resource list metadata property provides 
information about the number of records, pages and the number of records per page.
GET /devices/?page=6
It is possible to change the number of records returned per page by including the 'limit' option. The maximum allowed number of records 
per page is 100.
GET /devices/?page=6&limit=50The default response type will be 'text/json'.

Status Reponse Codes
Statuses from the API are provided as HTTP response statuses including any exceptions thrown by the API.
The following are the main status codes used by the Core API
 200 OK Success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded
401 or 419 Unauthorised The response status code indicates that the client request has not been completed because it lacks 
valid authentication credentials for the requested resource.
402 Payment RequiredThe subscription has expired
403 Forbidden Invalid credentials. The response status code indicates that there are insufficient rights to access 
the resource.
412 Precondition 
FailedPrerequisite not met and access to the target resource has been denied.
404 Not Found The response status code indicates that the server cannot find the requested resource.
409 Conflict The response status code indicates a request conflict or a duplicate of the target resource.
500 Internal Server 
ErrorA server error response code indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that 
prevented it from fulfilling the request.
This error response is a generic "catch-all" response.Status 
CodeDescription

Core API Endpoints
Data in the Core API is organised in an Organization hierarchy with devices being added to the organization where they have been installed 
or against the organization that owns the devices.
Due to the complex setup of some metering point types with multiple options on how you would want to view the data. The viewing of meter 
readings has been split into another endpoint called 'channels'. In order to view the readings for a metering point you need to use one of the 
channels that have been set up for that device, it is worth noting that you can have several channels per metering point with each channel 
viewing the data for that metering point in a different way. For example, one channel might be set up to only display 'phase 1' from that 
metering point and another might be only to display the 'phase' counter attached to that metering point.

Rate Limits
POST and PUT calls are rate limited based on the number of messages currently stored in the relevant Rabbit Message Queue (RMQ), and 
will return a 429 when a limit has been reached. This is to avoid crashing RMQ due to many large unprocessed generic ingress messages 
in RMQ. As of 13th Feb 2023 the production limit is set to 10000 messages viarmqDataIngressGenericMaxQueueSize in 
application/config.ini. The production config.ini file is located h e r e.
Insert new data
POST POST /dataingress/generic
Update existing data (indexed by ts+uuId)
PUT PUT /dataingress/generic
General ParametersThe POST request is limited to inserting up to 1000 rows at a time.
The PUT request is limited to updating up to 100 rows at a time.
PUT will NOT insert new rows.
If you have a mixture of new data and updated data, you can’t use PUT on it all. The new data will not get inserted without using

Custom Date Ranges
Custom date ranges are requested by supplying the daterange as an array, containing the start timestamp and 
the end timestamp.
The start time must be before the end time
The daterange timestamps can be  defined in seconds in the Unix Epoch Timestamp format (e.g., 
1694034000) which will provide granular date range selections
    e.g. daterange[]=1694034000&daterange[]=1694062800
Alternatively, the time stamps can be defined as "YYYY-MM-DD" which will provide granularity down to a day
    e.g. daterange[]=2023-09-06&daterange[]=2023-09-07
Pre-defined Ranges
The list of allowed pre-defined date ranges are:
today
yesterday
